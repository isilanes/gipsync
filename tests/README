# You can comment out some lines in this file, and then use it as a complete
# script to run tests and/or report coverage like that:
#
# $ bash tests/README

# Run single test file:
#coverage run --source=. -m tests/test_core -v

# Run all tests in test/ dir:
coverage run --source=. -m unittest discover -v

# Report coverage:
coverage report -m --skip-covered --omit="libgipsync/*_old.py,tests/coverage_log.py"

# Clean rubish:
rm -f .coverage
rm -f gipsync.pyc
